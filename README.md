## Description

This Application is a book search and storage site that is built by using the MERN stack. The application was already built but was built using RESTful API. I successfully refactored this application to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.

To see how this search engine works, see the **walk-through demonstration videos** here:[Click!](https://github.com/HuiPan-Peter/Social-Network-API_HuiPan/tree/main/public/walkthroughVideo%26Screenshot)
