## Description

This Application is a book search and storage site that is built by using the MERN stack. The application was already built but was built using RESTful API. I successfully refactored this application to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.

To see how this search engine works, see the **walk-through demonstration videos** here:[Click!](https://github.com/HuiPan-Peter/Search-Engine-withGraphQL/tree/main/assets)

#### Starting the Server

After installation :
- run the command `npm run build` which will run the Vite build process which will bundle the React source code.
- run the command `npm run develop` which will execute the vite, which starts the development server provided by Vite, and allows users to run the code on their local host.
- After a Sign-Up register as a user, you can start to explore how this search engine works.
